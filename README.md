# kittykernel

## Description
kittykernel is a cat-friendly, custom kernel manager for Linux Mint and other Debian derivates. 

## Features

* Manages your kernels with a handy GUI
* Can install *all* kernels available in repos (*e.g.* low-latency)
* Can remove and/or purge multiple kernels to clean up /boot
* If available: scrolls to the currently selected kernel in the changelog
* Convinces users by using an alliteration for its name

## Installation

Easiest and most common way: Just download the debian package under [*releases*](https://github.com/Schallaven/kittykernel/releases). This way, all necessary packages are installed.

Alternatively, download or clone the repository for the latest version. A handy *install* script is provided for convenience:

```bash
# ./install
```

After this, just run *kittykernel* to start the cat-friendly kernel manager. An icon is inserted into the control panel
for convenience.

At the moment, *kittykernel* is meant for testing environments _only_. Do not use in a productive environment!
