# This file allows to blacklist certain kernels or groups from the list in Kittykernel. Please be aware
# that hidden kernels will not be touched _at all_. Also, the active kernel is never filtered.

# "GROUP x.y" will hide the kernel group x.y
# "KERNEL pattern" will hide every kernel which matches "pattern"; "pattern" should be regular expression (see Python's re.match(...) function for details)

# Don't show these very old kernels
GROUP 4.4

# Bad kernels, should not be used
GROUP 4.13
KERNEL .*4.15.0-24-generic$

# Remove all lowlatency kernels
KERNEL .*-lowlatency$

# Remove all Google Cloud Platform kernels
KERNEL .*-gcp$

# Remove all Azure kernels
